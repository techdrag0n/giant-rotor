** BUG **
offsets in output file are off. seems to have to do with adding the loops and place in loop as well as positive or negative side of center.

if (MatchXPoint((uint32_t*)h0)) {

	// this seems to be involved in the bug resulting in wronge offset numbers in results.

	Int k(&key);
	 k.Add((uint64_t)CPU_GRP_SIZE / 2 + 1); // this was a quick attempt to fix bug. along with trying to subtract if negitive side.
//		k.Add((uint64_t)CPU_GRP_SIZE / 2+1 + i);  // half
	k.Add((uint64_t)i);
